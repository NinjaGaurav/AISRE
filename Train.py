Implementation of RAISR in Python by Jalali-Lab  

[RAISR](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7744595) (Rapid and Accurate Image Super 
Resolution) is an image processing algorithm published by Google Research in 2016. With sufficient 
trainingData, consisting of low and high resolution image pairs, RAISR algorithm tries to learn
a set of filters which can be applied to an input image that is not in the training set, 
to produce a higher resolution version of it. The source code released here is the Jalali-Lab 
implementation of the RAISR algorithm in Python 3.x. The implementation presented here achieved 
performance results that are comparable to that presented in Google's research paper 
(with ± 0.1 dB in PSNR). 

Just-in-time (JIT) compilation employing JIT numba is used to speed up the Python code. A very 
parallelized Python code employing multi-processing capabilities is used to speed up the testing 
process. The code has been tested on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X 10.13.2 platforms.

Dependencies
All the dependent Python modules needed for the using our RAISR implementation can be installed 
using pip package manager and are the following:

*  NumPy
*  Numba
*  Python Imaging Library (PIL)
*  scipy
*  os
*  pickle
*  skimage

Training
All the training images are to be stored in the **trainingData** directory, before executing the 
Train.py script. In the training script, modify the upscaling factor, R, appropriately. The training 
outputs three files, **filter.txt**, **Qfactor_str.txt**, and **Qfactor_coh.txt**, which are needed in 
the testing phase. The trainingData used in this implementation is the **BSD 200** ([Martin et al. ICCV 2001](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/)). A pre-trained filter with upscaling factors x2, x3, and x4 are available for testing in the **Filter** directory.
